	<h1>I Like For You To Be Still</h1>
	<p class="first">I like for you to be still<br/>
It is as though you are absent<br/>
And you hear me from far away<br/>
And my voice does not touch you<br/>
It seems as though your eyes had flown away<br/>
And it seems that a kiss had sealed your mouth<br/>
As all things are filled with my soul<br/>
You emerge from the things<br/>
Filled with my soul<br/>
You are like my soul<br/>
A butterfly of dream<br/>
And you are like the word: Melancholy</p>

	<div style="background:url(Starsinthesky.jpg) no-repeat left top;">
		<p class="second">I like for you to be still<br/>
And you seem far away<br/>
It sounds as though you are lamenting<br/>
A butterfly cooing like a dove<br/>
And you hear me from far away<br/>
And my voice does not reach you<br/>
Let me come to be still in your silence<br/>
And let me talk to you with your silence<br/>
That is bright as a lamp<br/>
Simple, as a ring<br/>
You are like the night<br/>
With its stillness and constellations<br/>
Your silence is that of a star<br/>
As remote and candid</p>

	<p class="third">I like for you to be still<br/>
It is as though you are absent<br/>
Distant and full of sorrow<br/>
So you would've died<br/>
One word then, One smile is enough<br/>
And I'm happy;<br/>
Happy that it's not true<br/>
